 so need to pull configuration in a differnt way before deploying/distributing.


```zsh
export MYNA_SLACK_TOKEN="xxxxxxxx"
```

## Testing


### Test Locally

Commands require a publically accessible call back. You can set up `ngrok` to get a public URL and get requests tunneled to your `localhost`.

1. Create a free account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)

2. Follow the [setup instructions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup)

3. ... TODO: more steps reg ports etc
