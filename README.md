  ]
end
```

TODO: termporary env variable setup, this only works at compile time,
 so need to pull configuration in a differnt way before deploying/distributing.


```zsh
export MYNA_SLACK_TOKEN="xxxxxxxx"
```

## 🧪 Testing


### Test Locally

Commands require a publically accessible call back. You can set up `ngrok` to get a public URL and get requests tunneled to your `localhost`.

1. Create a free account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)

2. Follow the [setup instructions](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup)

3. ... TODO: more steps reg ports etc


## ✅ Pre-Commit

How to setup git pre-commit hooks to keep this project nice and clean:

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) if it is not yet installed.
2. Run
   ```zsh
   pre-commit install
   ```

ℹ️ You can regularly upgrade the existing commit hooks to the latest verion by running:
```zsh
pre-commit autoupdate
```
